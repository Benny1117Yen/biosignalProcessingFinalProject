Recently, some methods for non-invasive cuff-less estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures have been proposed in the literature. ``One of the most prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time (PTT). Although PTT has been shown to have a strong correlation with systolic and diastolic blood pressures, this relationship is highly dependent on the phsiological characteristics of each individual.`` Therefore, each person needs to be calibrated to make accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from PTT, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, ``in our project, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free.`` Our goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as regression algorithms. ``The results indicated that the BP-feature based madel has a reliable estimation of blood pressure.``
